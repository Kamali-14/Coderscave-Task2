# Climate Data Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing historical weather data to gain insights into climate patterns, trends, and anomalies. Utilizing a dataset sourced from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), the goal is to understand climate changes, identify patterns, and provide valuable information for future environmental decisions.

## Dataset

### Hourly Dataset: 
This dataset contains climate data recorded at hourly intervals. It includes parameters such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure measured hourly over a specified period.

### Monthly Dataset: 
The monthly dataset aggregates climate data on a monthly basis. It provides averages, maximums, and minimums of various climate variables recorded over each month, allowing for seasonal analysis and trend identification.

### Daily Dataset: 
The daily dataset consists of climate data recorded on a daily basis. It includes parameters similar to the hourly dataset but aggregated at the daily level, enabling analysis of daily fluctuations and trends over longer periods.

### Three-Hour Dataset: 
This dataset captures climate data at three-hour intervals. It offers a compromise between the high time resolution of the hourly dataset and the lower granularity of the daily dataset, making it suitable for analyzing medium-term climate variations.

## Code Overview

### Data Cleaning
The data cleaning process involves handling missing values, ensuring data consistency, and addressing outliers. Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy are used to clean and preprocess the dataset, ensuring its suitability for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies within the climate data. Descriptive statistics and summarization techniques are applied to understand the distribution of temperature and precipitation over time.

### Visualizations
Various visualization techniques, including line charts, heatmaps, and geographical plots, are employed to illustrate key insights derived from the climate data. Libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn are utilized to create informative visualizations depicting temperature variations, precipitation patterns, and regional climate differences.

## Conclusion
By employing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization techniques, this project aims to provide valuable insights into historical climate data. The findings can inform decision-making processes in environmental planning, resource management, and understanding the impacts of climate change. This analysis contributes to a better understanding of long-term climate trends and supports initiatives for sustainable practices.
